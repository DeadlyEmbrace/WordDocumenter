# WordDocumenter
Just a little program I'm writing to keep track of Japanese words and phrases that I learn. You can type in a simple Romaji phrase or word and it's english equavalent and have it written to a textfile of your choosing. The program will keep track of this file and always write new words there. I'm looking into automating the translation process.

This project exists mainly for me to get used to using GitHub.

You can build the project using Visual Studio 2013.

The project is still far from complete and I may or may not update it depending on many things.
